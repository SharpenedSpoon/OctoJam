# Octo-ber Jam Meteor Webapp
###### Author: [Ian Douglas](http://subfacet.com/)

This is a [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) webapp created for the Octo-ber Jam, but also designed to also act as a generic webapp to facilitate any ol' game jam.

Octo is a compiler and emulator for Chip8, and you can read more about it (and try it out) [here](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo)!

	* For the Octo-ber Jam, the game will also be displayed as an iframe embed
